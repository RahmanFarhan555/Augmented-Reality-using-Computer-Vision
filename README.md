# Augmented-Reality-using-Computer-Vision
 The goal is to develop an algorithm capable of detecting ArUco markers in the images and
 accurately placing AR images in their respective positions. By leveraging computer vision
 techniques, particularly with libraries like OpenCV, the aim to seamlessly integrate digital
 content, such as a poster, into real-world environments. This involves precise marker de
tection to determine the 3D positioning of the scene, enabling the proper alignment of AR
 elements. Through this project, I seek to showcase the potential of augmented reality
 technology in enhancing interior spaces, providing insights into the practical application
 of computer vision for AR applications
